1. Create database emails with following tables:

mails: id_mail, ip_address, country_code, subject, to, cc, bcc, is_html, text, file, status (sent, error), date_time
errors: id_error, id_mail, message, date_time

2. Install composer. Add PHPMailer to your project with composer (vendor).

3. Create test.php file to send test mail with your credentials. Add task4.pdf attachment to the mail.

4. Create mail.php that has form to send emails. Form has fields:

subject: required
to: required
cc: ( use <input type="email" id="emails" name="emails" multiple>. Separate each email address with a comma. )
bcc: ( use <input type="email" id="emails" name="emails" multiple>. Separate each email address with a comma. )
is html (checkbox)
text: (textarea) required
file: for sending file to the directory files
send button
cancel button

Sent data with POST method to send.php file. Send.php checks if required data is entered and if something is wrong redirect user to the mail.php and write proper message.

File send.php detects IP address and use https://api.country.is/185.90.134.203 API for getting country code. Use CURL for getting data.

// https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php

$url = "https://api.country.is/185.90.134.203";
$client = curl_init($url);
curl_setopt($client, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
$response = curl_exec($client);
$result = json_decode($response, true);

var_dump($result);

For getting country code create function getCountryCode(string $ipAddress):array


For getting IP Address use

function getIpAddress(): string
{

    if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'])) {
        $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_CLIENT_IP'];
    } elseif (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
        $ip = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
    } else {
        $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
    }

    if (!filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP)) {
        $ip = "unknown";
    }

    return $ip;
}




If is html is not checked strip tags from text. Upload files in files directory. Change name of file with following pattern: timestamp-mt_rand(1000,100000).extension

Insert all data in table mails. If file is uploaded add it to the mail as attachment.

If something went wrong with email sending, insert data in table errors (also Exception message). If email is sent correctly update status in table mails to sent.

Put MySQL database and files on your web server.

Test script with several version of mails, using cc, bcc, files, html version and not html version.
